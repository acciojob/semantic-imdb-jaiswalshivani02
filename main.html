		<P>Sultan Ali Khan is a middle-aged local wrestler and ex-wrestling champion living a lonely life in a small town of Rewari, Haryana. Aakash Oberoi, the founder of a private mixed martial arts league backed by Mr. Patel, is encouraged by his father to recruit Sultan to salvage its popularity. After travelling to Haryana, he gives the recruitment offer to Sultan, who bluntly refuses and says that he has completely retired from wrestling. In search of the reason behind his retirement, Aakash confronts Sultan's close friend Govind, who narrates how Sultan's career began.</P>
